# CSE 253 Programming Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment was to experiment with different properties of a neural network and evaluate its ability to classify different fashion items. We use the Fashion MNIST data set, a data set made by Zalando (European e-commerce company). The data set contains 10 different types of fashion categories and has 70 000 gray scale images in total if you combine the test and training data set.
